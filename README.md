Gesture Captioning Application

This Gesture Captioning Application uses hand gestures for an interactive experience, powered by MediaPipe for hand tracking and a BLIP model for image captioning. The app allows users to draw shapes using gestures and provides real-time captions based on the selected area. It includes multiple modes such as:
Draw & Caption: Draw shapes to generate captions for the selected region of the image.
Object Recognition: Recognize and label objects within a selected area.
The app can be used in various practical applications like:
Educational Tool: Interactive learning by circling objects in educational materials to get explanations and translations.
Accessibility Application: Assists visually impaired users by describing their surroundings.
Shopping/Product Recognition: Provides information about products by selecting them from images.
Museum/Gallery Guide: Interactive museum tours by selecting artwork or exhibits.

Key Features:
Gesture-based Interaction: Users can interact with the app using hand gestures for drawing and selection.
Real-time Captioning: Generates captions for selected regions of images using a pretrained BLIP model.
Multiple Modes: Different modes provide flexibility for education, accessibility, and analysis.
Threading for Model Loading: The model is loaded in the background to optimize performance.
